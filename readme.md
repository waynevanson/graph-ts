## Prerequisite

Besides the typescript language, you should understand how the State, Reader and Option monads function.

We have implemented `StateReaderOption` and give you access to `StateReaderOption` and `ReaderOption` to use.
These will be added to `fp-ts-contrib` when the in code documentation is complete.
